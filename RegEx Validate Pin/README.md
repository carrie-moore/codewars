## Kata: RegEx Validate Pin Code 
https://www.codewars.com/kata/regex-validate-pin-code

ATM machines allow 4 or 6 digit PIN codes and PIN codes cannot contain anything but exactly 4 digits or exactly 6 digits.

If the function is passed a valid PIN string, return true, else return false.

no partner, did these at home

### Plan AKA Whiteboard: 
Run sample tests and gather clues

look up regex commands for length and then combine the ones for 4 and 6

return true/false with test command
